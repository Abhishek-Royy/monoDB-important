**  Case Insensetive word search in MongoDB =>
        -> To do this work we need to use=> RegularExpression();
        -> 
    app.get("/find",async(req,res)=>{
        // RegExp <- it is a method,
    let rd=new RegExp("jeoRaxy","i");   <- in the first "invited comma" we write the search element and "second invited comma" we ure "i". <= "i" means insensitive. it allow uppercase,lowercase both , if the meaning is same.
    let data=await mongodb.find({username: rd});
    res.send(data);
});

**
   RegExp - has two more term ->
        / we define how was the start (^)
        / we define how was the end ($)
